# Properties of Array in C

An array in C is a fixed-size homogeneous collection of elements stored at a contiguous memory location. It is a derived data type in C that can store elements of different data types such as int, char, struct, etc.

## Fixed Size of an Array

In C, the size of an array is fixed after its declaration. It should be known at the compile time and it cannot be modified later in the program.

## Homogeneous Collection

An array in C cannot have elements of different data types. All the elements are of the same type.

## Indexing in an Array

Indexing of elements in an Array in C starts with 0 instead of 1. It means that the index of the first element will be 0 and the last element will be (size â€“ 1) where size is the size of the array.

## Dimensions of the Array

An array in C can be a single dimensional like a 1-D array or multidimensional like a 2-D array, 3-D array, and so on. It can have any number of dimensions.

**NOTE**: *The number of elements in a multidimensional array is the product of the size of all the dimensions.*
