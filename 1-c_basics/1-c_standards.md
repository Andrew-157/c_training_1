## C-Standards

The C programming language has several standard versions, with the most commonly used ones being C89/C90, C99, C11, and C18:

1. C89/C90 (ANSI C or ISO C) was the first standardized version of the language, released in 1989 and 1990, respectively. This standard introduced many of the features that are still used in modern C programming, including data types, control structures, and the standard library.

2. C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999) introduced several new features, including variable-length arrays, flexible array members, complex numbers, inline functions, and designated initializers. This standard also includes several new library functions and updates to existing ones.

3. C11 (ISO/IEC 9899:2011) introduced several new features, including _Generic, static_assert, and the atomic type qualifier. This standard also includes several updates to the library, including new functions for math, threads, and memory manipulation.

4. C18 (ISO/IEC 9899:2018) is the most recent standard and includes updates and clarifications to the language specification and the library.

When writing C code, it’s important to know which standard version is being used and to write code that is compatible with that standard. Many compilers support multiple standard versions, and it’s often possible to specify which version to use with a compiler flag or directive.
